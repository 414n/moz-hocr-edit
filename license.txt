hocr-edit is licensed under a disjunctive tri-license giving you the
choice of one of the three following sets of free software/open source
licensing terms:

    * Mozilla Public License, version 1.1 or later
    * GNU General Public License, version 2.0 or later
    * GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or later

This tri-license was chosen because it is the same license as Mozilla
itself.
